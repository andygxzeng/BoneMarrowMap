Description: This is a package enabling rapid and accurate projection onto a curated scRNA-seq atlas of Bone Marrow hematopoiesis. 
    Our goal in developing this resource is to provide a large-scale and comprehensive reference atlas of human hematopoiesis in the bone marrow, 
    and critically to ensure balanced representation of CD34+ stem and progenitor cells together with CD34- terminally differentiated populations.
    This provides us with a deep profile of lineage transition in both early and late stages of human hematopoiesis. 
    Cell state annotations within this atlas were carefully validated to maximize concordance with immunophenotypically and functionally pure cell populations
    that are well established in experimental hematology. In particular, our transcriptional HSC state is highly concordant with functional LT-HSCs.
    We provide functions to rapidly and accurately map query scRNA-seq data from normal or leukemic hematopoietic cells onto our bone marrow atlas. 
    Mapping, QC Filtering, CellType prediction, Pseudotime prediction, and Composition analysis can be performed from raw count matrices within minutes
    (~10min total for ~10,000 cells on a personal laptop).
